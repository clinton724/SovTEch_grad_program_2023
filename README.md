## How to Bootsrap the app 
> There are 3 ways in which the app can be bootstraped. The app can be bootstraped using the Bootstrap
  CDN, importing Bootstrap in React as a dependency or installing a React Bootstrap package. The method 
  described here is the Bootstrap CDN, which is the simple one.

  ### Guide to using the Bootstrap CDN method
  - Include a link to the CDN in the head section of the index.html file. For the current stable version,
    the link is as follows: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous">`
  - After including the above link, we can start using built-in Bootstrap classes and JavaScript components 
    in the app components.
